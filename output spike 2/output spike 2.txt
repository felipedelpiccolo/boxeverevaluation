As an output of this spike I checked what Astynax really is and how to use it with cassandra.

Astynax is a JAVA client developed by Netfix to interact with cassandra DB, this client offers many features like:

High level, simple object oriented interface to Cassandra.
Fail-over behaviour on the client side.
Connection pool abstraction. Implementation of a round robin connection pool.
Monitoring abstraction to get event notification from the connection pool.
Complete encapsulation of the underlying Thrift API and structs.
Automatic retry of downed hosts.
Automatic discovery of additional hosts in the cluster.
Suspension of hosts for a short period of time after several timeouts.
Annotations to simplify use of composite columns.

The Apache Cassandra database is a column oriented database that suits when you need scalability and high-availability without compromising performance.


Also as an output of this spike I created a web app in play to show how to use astyanax together with play and cassandra. 
The application can be found in the folder astyanaxWebApp. Only configuration needed is install cassandra 1.1.12 and create keyspaces and column families executing the scripts in conf/cassandra.dll
Then you can run the application as usual with play run. Accessing http://localhost:9000/users/list you can see and create Users.
